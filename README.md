```

## Oracle Configuration

### Setting Up IoT Integration
1. **Register Environmental Project** with location and type
2. **Configure Data Source** identifier for sensors/oracles
3. **Authorize Oracle Addresses** that can submit data
4. **Set Minimum Thresholds** for automatic credit generation
5. **Enable Real-time Processing** for continuous monitoring

### Data Validation Rules
- **Freshness Check**: Data must be submitted within 24 hours (144 blocks)
- **Threshold Validation**: Minimum 100 units of carbon offset required
- **Source Matching**: Data source must match project configuration
- **Oracle Authorization**: Only authorized principals can submit data
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Each data submission is uniquely identified

## NFT Metadata

Each carbon credit NFT includes rich metadata accessible via the `get-token-uri` function:
- Credit amount and type
- Project information
- Verification status
- Creation timestamp
- Environmental impact data
- **Oracle Information**: Data source, sensor ID, generation method
- **Automation Status**: Whether credit was oracle-generated or manual

Metadata format: `https://greentrack.io/api/metadata/{token-id}`

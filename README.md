4. **Automated Credit Generation** creates verified NFT credits for qualifying projects
5. **Real-time Updates** to project totals and user balances

### Supported Data Sources
- **Renewable Energy Meters**: Solar, wind, hydro generation data
- **Carbon Sequestration Sensors**: Forest monitoring, soil carbon measurement
- **Emission Monitoring**: Industrial emission tracking and reduction
- **Environmental IoT**: Temperature, humidity, air quality sensors
- **Satellite Data**: Deforestation monitoring, land use changes

### Security Features
- **Oracle Authorization**: Only pre-approved oracles can submit data
- **Data Freshness**: Automatic rejection of outdated sensor readings
- **Threshold Validation**: Minimum carbon offset requirements prevent spam
- **Source Validation**: Data sources must match project configurations
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: All oracle submissions permanently recorded

## Getting Started

### Usage Example
```clarity
;; Register a new project with oracle support
(contract-call? .greentrack register-project "Solar Farm Project" "California, USA" "renewable-energy")

;; Enable oracle data for the project
(contract-call? .greentrack enable-project-oracle u1 "solar-meter-sensor-001")

;; Authorize an environmental data oracle
(contract-call? .greentrack authorize-oracle 'ST1HTBVD3JG9C05J7HBJTHGR0GGW7KXW28M5JS8QE "solar-meter-sensor-001")

;; Oracle submits environmental data (automated by IoT sensors)

;; Retire credits (burn NFT)
(contract-call? .greentrack retire-credit u1)
```

## Oracle Configuration

### Setting Up IoT Integration
1. **Register Environmental Project** with location and type
2. **Configure Data Source** identifier for sensors/oracles
3. **Authorize Oracle Addresses** that can submit data
4. **Set Minimum Thresholds** for automatic credit generation
5. **Enable Real-time Processing** for continuous monitoring

### Data Validation Rules
- **Freshness Check**: Data must be submitted within 24 hours (144 blocks)
- **Threshold Validation**: Minimum 100 units of carbon offset required
- **Source Matching**: Data source must match project configuration
- **Oracle Authorization**: Only authorized principals can submit data
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Each data submission is uniquely identified

## NFT Metadata

Each carbon credit NFT includes rich metadata accessible via the `get-token-uri` function:
- Credit amount and type
- Project information
- Verification status
- Creation timestamp
- Environmental impact data
- **Oracle Information**: Data source, sensor ID, generation method
- **Automation Status**: Whether credit was oracle-generated or manual

Metadata format: `https://greentrack.io/api/metadata/{token-id}`
